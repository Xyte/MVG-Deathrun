GM.MenuText = [[Welcome to Deathrun!

The goal of a Runner is to make it to the end of the map. The map, in most cases, is just one huge death-trap. To make it to the end, you'll have to somehow survive all the traps activated by the Death players.

The goal of a Death is to kill all of the Runners by utilizing the traps within the map.
